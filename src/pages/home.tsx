                        creating every detail, every piece of landscape, every leaf and every tree by hand. I have programmed interactive objects, sounds and music. I've used particles to generate
                         such effects as fireflies, falling leaves and petals, smoke and haze. </p>
                        <p className="justified lead">You can create truly wonderful things in virtual reality, and it is so much fun to play together with friends after you've created them.</p>

                         for the pre-recorded trailers and 360Â° videos</p>

Fortunately, they've added a Creator mode, which I used to experiment with minigames and programming simple interactive objects. I have really liked to sequence music using Fortnite objects, too pity that they are no longer properly supported in the newer Fortnite versions.
